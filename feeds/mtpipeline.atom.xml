The intern will work with our group to develop, test, and run our software pipeline which processes Solar System object observations ("moving targets") taken with the Hubble Space Telescope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moving Target Pipeline is the first attempt in the 22-year history of the Hubble Space Telescope to create a generalized data processing pipeline to meet the unique requirements of Solar System data. Using Python and MySQL the pipeline creates calibrated science data, dynamically scaled preview images, and predicts possible detections of "incidental" or serendipitous objects such as moons and asteroids. These data products and software techniques are of broad interest to the solar system research community as well as STScI, even influencing plans for the new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). More information on the project can be found &lt;a href="http://acviana.github.io/posts/2013/mtpipeline-ddrf/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an ideal opportunity for a student interested in software development, whose goal is either a career in software or wishes to add programming to his or her highly-desirable skill set. Our intern will be exposed to many aspects of professional software development including documentation, testing, code reviews, distributed version control, and remote software execution. Last year's intern in our group (a college senior) reported the internship experience helpful in both job interviews and subsequently, on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong candidates for this position will have experience in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working in the Linux command line  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Python programming language  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL databases, specifically MySQL  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Version control, specifically Git and GitHub  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A demonstrated ability to work and learn independently as well as attention to detail are all valued. A background in astronomy or physics is desirable but not required. Applicants with other relevant qualifications, such as experience in other programming languages or success in prior internships, are encouraged to demonstrate how they could contribute to our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidates are invited apply by follow this &lt;a href="http://www.stsci.edu/institute/smo/students/applications"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;. Women and minorities are especially encouraged to apply. The deadline for applications is January 31st, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that all applications go into a general applicant pool and will be considered for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;  internship opportunities available through the SASP. If you are specifically interested in an internship with our Moving Target project please include the words "Moving Target" somewhere in your application to ensure our group reviews your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to your application,&lt;/p&gt;

The grant came from an internal source called the Director's Discretionary Research Fund (DDRF). My project, called the Moving Target Pipeline, was fully funded at $21,000 and allows me to buy back 25% of my time for one year to work on the project. Here is the proposal abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We propose a moving target pipeline for the WFC3 and ACS instruments based our existing WFPC2 software to produce properly drizzled FITS images, dynamically scaled preview images, and predicted ephemeris positions. Such a pipeline is relevant to ongoing HST scientific observations, the Hubble Legacy Archive (HLA), and serves to lay the design groundwork for JWSTâ€™s moving target processing. We request funds to support a senior RIA for our software development activities. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing from the proposal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our WFPC2 pipeline addresses the 4 main issues that impede performing Solar System astronomy with HST archival data: (1) identifying cosmic rays, (2) drizzling, (3) scaled preview images, and (4) identifying incidental ephemeris observations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image gives an attractive visual of what we can already accomplish for WFPC2 data and will expand to the WFC3 and ACS cameras:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the full proposal &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/04m5rboqkkmzuvm/2013_Fall_DDRF_Proposal_No_Recs.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Our project will be open source and available on GitHub. It will be an extension of our existing work on a citizen science project for WFPC2 which you can browse &lt;a href="" title="https://github.com/STScI-Citizen-Science/MTPipeline"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This builds off a number of other grants and &lt;a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/planetpipeline/index.html"&gt;existing work&lt;/a&gt; in this area &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that this phase of the project will be useful for planetary scientists using HST.&lt;/p&gt;
