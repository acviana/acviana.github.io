The grant came from an internal source called the Director's Discretionary Research Fund (DDRF). My project, called the Moving Target Pipeline, was fully funded at $21,000 and allows me to buy back 25% of my time for one year to work on the project. Here is the proposal abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We propose a moving target pipeline for the WFC3 and ACS instruments based our existing WFPC2 software to produce properly drizzled FITS images, dynamically scaled preview images, and predicted ephemeris positions. Such a pipeline is relevant to ongoing HST scientific observations, the Hubble Legacy Archive (HLA), and serves to lay the design groundwork for JWSTâ€™s moving target processing. We request funds to support a senior RIA for our software development activities. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing from the proposal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our WFPC2 pipeline addresses the 4 main issues that impede performing Solar System astronomy with HST archival data: (1) identifying cosmic rays, (2) drizzling, (3) scaled preview images, and (4) identifying incidental ephemeris observations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image gives an attractive visual of what we can already accomplish for WFPC2 data and will expand to the WFC3 and ACS cameras:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the full proposal &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/04m5rboqkkmzuvm/2013_Fall_DDRF_Proposal_No_Recs.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Our project will be open source and available on GitHub. It will be an extension of our existing work on a citizen science project for WFPC2 which you can browse &lt;a href="" title="https://github.com/STScI-Citizen-Science/MTPipeline"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that our work will be useful for planetary scientists using HST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure, I misspelled "activities" in the actual abstract. &lt;em&gt;facepalm&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the trouble with poetry is&lt;br /&gt;
that it encourages the writing of more poetry&lt;br /&gt;
 - Billy Collins, &lt;a href="http://www.edutopia.org/trouble-poetry"&gt;The Trouble with Poetry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase one of my favorite poets, the trouble with tech blogs is that they encourage the writing of more tech blogs. The Internet probably doesn't need another tech blog but I think this will be a fun way for me to both share and keep track of what I'm working on. Hopefully, some people will at least find it entertaining if not helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to start this blog over a year ago with Octopress. I'd never worked with ruby before but I immediately feel in love with the idea of static HTML generated from Markdown. It seemed so elegant yet customizable, definitely a hacker's blogging platform. Of course I almost immediately broke the deploy step to GitHub and got pulled away to other projects. Then I stumbled across Pelican earlier this year, which is the same idea as Octopress but in Python! After several false starts I now finally have a working blog again! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so another tech blog begins!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="pelican"></category><category term=""></category></entry></feed>
