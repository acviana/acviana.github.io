&lt;p&gt;the trouble with poetry is&lt;br /&gt;
that it encourages the writing of more poetry&lt;br /&gt;
 - Billy Collins, &lt;a href="http://www.edutopia.org/trouble-poetry"&gt;The Trouble with Poetry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase one of my favorite poets, the trouble with tech blogs is that they encourage the writing of more tech blogs. The Internet probably doesn't need another tech blog but I think this will be a fun way for me to both share and keep track of what I'm working on. Hopefully, some people will at least find it entertaining if not helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to start this blog over a year ago with Octopress. I'd never worked with ruby before but I immediately feel in love with the idea of static HTML generated from Markdown. It seemed so elegant yet customizable, definitely a hacker's blogging platform. Of course I almost immediately broke the deploy step to GitHub and got pulled away to other projects. Then I stumbled across Pelican earlier this year, which is the same idea as Octopress but in Python! After several false starts I now finally have a working blog again! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so another tech blog begins!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="pelican"></category><category term=""></category></entry></feed>
