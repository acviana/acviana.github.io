		</h1>
		<p>I spent 12 hours on a plane this week traveling between the East Coast and San Fransisco for the RSA conference. I've appreciated the way flying forces me to disconnect and spend a little bit more time on side projects such as this blog. On this particular flight picked up an idea I've been wanting to play with for a while, overloading Python's special object methods.</p>
<h3>Magic Methods</h3>
<p>These are the object methods that begin with a double underscore such as <code>__init__</code> and are also known as "magic", "double-underscore", or "dunder" methods. These methods define a lot of the inherent behavior of Python objects, including the Python built-ins such as lists and dictionaries. These methods also define how objects interact with operators such as <code>+</code> (the <code>__add__</code> method) and <code>&lt;=</code> (the <code>__leq__</code> operator).</p>
<p>Because so much of how Python works is wrapped up in these method I figured messing with them would be a good way to gain a deeper understanding of the language. So I started making little toy classes that implemented these methods in weird ways and everything was going as I expected until I got to the <code>__contains__</code> method. The <code>__contains__</code> method is the method used to check membership using the <code>in</code> operator. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>In [1]: &#39;foo&#39; in [&#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;]
Out[1]: True

In [2]: [&#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;].__contains__(&#39;foo&#39;)
Out[2]: True

In [3]: 1 in [&#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;]
Out[3]: False

In [4]: [&#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;].__contains__(1)
Out[4]: False
</pre></div>


<p>In each case the <code>__contains__</code> method of Python's built-in list object is being called to evaluate the <code>in</code> operator. As it turns out this is an over simplification. I realized this when I took my first pass at building my own <code>__contains__</code> method and I did something a little weird:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">MyObject</span>(<span class="n">object</span>):

    <span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">__contains__</span>(<span class="k">self</span>, <span class="n">y</span>):
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">&#39;__contains__&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This is a non-sense method, returning a string instead of a Boolean is unexpected behavior and doesn't make sense in the context of evaluating an object membership. But I just figured it would always evaluate to <code>False</code>. A little more exploration showed that there was something special about the <code>in</code> operator.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>In [1]: mo = MyObject()

In [2]: mo.__contains__(1)
Out[2]: &#39;__contains__&#39;

In [3]: mo.__contains__(1) == True
Out[3]: False

In [4]: 1 in mo
Out[4]: True
</pre></div>


<p>I was expecting <code>1 in mo</code> to evaluate to something like <code>mo.__contains__(1) == True</code> which evaluates to <code>__contains__ == True</code> which should be <code>False</code>. Instead I'm got <code>True</code>, so there was something I didn't understand going on.</p>
<p>A little but of searching on StackOverflow led me to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/18753584/1216837">this hint</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, <code>in</code> always casts the result of <code>__contains__</code> to a bool</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this answers my question but doesn't really teach me much more about Python. This is the beauty about being on a plane. Normally, if I ran into something like this at work I would just take this answer at face value and moved on. But instead being stuck on a plane I had the time and incentive to go a little further down rabbit hole and read the cpython source.</p>
<h3>Reading the Source</h3>
<p>I've only looked at the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/2.7">cpython source code</a> a few times before this. I've never written a line of C in my life but I've been programming long enough that I can kind of squint and make out the flow of most things.</p>
<p>It didn't take me too long to get oriented enough to find an example of how the <code>__contains__</code> object is <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/2.7/Objects/listobject.c#L438">implemented</a> in an function called <code>list_contains</code> in the <code>listobject.c</code> file. This function iterates over the object contents calling the c <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/6f0eb93183519024cb360162bdd81b9faec97ba6/Objects/object.c#L727">function</a> on each one.</p>
<p>The comment on the <code>PyObject_RichCompareBool</code> function reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>/<em> Perform a rich comparison with integer result.  This wraps
   PyObject_RichCompare(), returning -1 for error, 0 for false, 1 for true. </em>/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK so our casting as of everything as a boolean must happen in here. Digging in a little more this function drops down into the <code>PyObject_IsTrue</code> <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/6f0eb93183519024cb360162bdd81b9faec97ba6/Objects/object.c#L1314">function</a>. And here we finally have our answer. <code>PyObject_IsTrue</code> checks if the input is <code>True</code>, <code>False</code>, <code>None</code> and then a handful of sequence types. If none of these are true the function returns <code>1</code>, which cascades up to <code>__contains__</code> and is then interpreted as <code>True</code>.</p>
